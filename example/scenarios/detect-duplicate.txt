# Format:
# # means it's a commment
# Each scenario has 3 parts:
# Each part is seperated by ">===<"
#
# 1st part: Define topology. The format is either the following or "linear" or "tree"
#
# <id>-<id2>
#
# <id> is the number of a node
# <id2> is the number of another node
# Note: "-" must exist.
# Example:
#	0-1
#	1-2
#
#
#
# 2nd part: Define groups (Can either be "random" or have the following format)
#
# <id> A B C D
# <id2> A B C
#
# Where <id> is the number of the a node and "ABCD" are topics
# Example:
# 	0 A B
#   1 C D
#   2 A B C D
#
#
# 3rd part: Actions (Can either be "random" or have the following format)
#
# Each line has the format:
#	T N G
#
#	T: Time of the action
#	N: Node number
#	G: Group topic
#
#	T N crash (Crashes node N at time T)
#
#	T N uncrash (Revives node N at time T)
#
# 	NOTE: This must be used alongside a static nodes-to-groups.txt
#	NOTE2: In this mode, every action takes 1 time tick (Messages take 1 time tick)
#   NOTE3: Time starts at 0, node IDs start at 0
